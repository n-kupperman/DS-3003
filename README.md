## About the Course

This course provides practical experiences about how data is commonly used in communication. The general objective is to make you familiar with how to effectively summarize and visualize data in order to share your story. All the examples and analyses will be done mainly in R, with a particular focus on graphical presentations with the R visualization tools like ggplot2, Plotly, and Shiny.

## What You Will Learn Along the Way

    By the end of the course, I hope that you will
    be excited about summarizing and visualizing data using R.
    be able to construct meaningful messages from data and effectively deliver them with visualization tools.
    create a portfolio showcasing your communication and visualization skills.
    have confidence in interacting and collaborating with colleagues.

The pledge must be signed by the student. For more information, visit www.virginia.edu/honor.


Special Needs:  The University of Virginia accommodates students with disabilities. Any SCPS student with a disability who needs accommodation (e.g., in arrangements for seating, extended time for examinations, or note-taking, etc.), should contact the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) and provide them with appropriate medical or psychological documentation of his/her condition. Once accommodations are approved, just follow up with me concerning any logistics and implementation of accommodations.  Please try to make accommodations for test-taking at least 14 business days in advance of the date of the test(s).
