Subject Area and Catalog Number: Data Science, DS 2003, Section 17703 -or- 19026

Year, Term: 2022, Fall

Class Title: Communicating with Data

Level: Undergraduate

Credit Type: Grade (A-F)

## About the Course

This course provides practical experiences about how data is commonly used in communication. The general objective is to make you familiar with how to effectively summarize and visualize data in order to share your story. All the examples and analyses will be done mainly in R, with a particular focus on graphical presentations with the R visualization tools like ggplot2, Plotly, and Shiny.

## What You Will Learn Along the Way

    By the end of the course, I hope that you will
    be excited about summarizing and visualizing data using R.
    be able to construct meaningful messages from data and effectively deliver them with visualization tools.
    create a portfolio showcasing your communication and visualization skills.
    have confidence in interacting and collaborating with colleagues.

## How You'll Know You Are Learning
This course will be a combination of lectures and labs. As the course progresses, it will be become more lab based. During lab sessions, you should expected to spend your time on your computer working through examples with the class. The best way to become comfortable with the material is to continually practice. The idea by making this lab-based class is that you can practice in an environment where you can ask questions and trouble-shoot with peers. Every class won't go perfect, but week after week you should be more comfortable R and the material. 

     Reflection/s (15%)
     
     Quizzes (lab completion?) (20%)
     
     Assignments (20%) - There will be weekly assignments due. These assignments are meant to reiterate the content from the week. Students are asked to        work independently on these assignments. 
     
     Mid-term Project (20%) - Groups of 3
     
     Final Project (25%) - Groups of 3

## Tech Stack
     R/Rstudio -
     Github - Almost all course materials and collaboration for lab assignments
     Collab - Submission of assignments, grades, class-wide communications

## Class Policies

Grading Policies: Courses carrying a Data Science subject area use the following grading system: A, A-; B+, B, B-; C+, C, C-; D+, D, D-; F.  The symbol W is used when a student officially drops a course before its completion or if the student withdraws from an academic program of the University.

Grading Scale: 

 - 93-100 A
 - 90-92 A- 
 - 87-89 B+
 - 83-86 B 
 - 80-82 B- 
 - 77-79 C+ 
 - 73-76 C 
 - 70-72 C- 
 - <70 F

University of Virginia Honor System: All work should be pledged in the spirit of the Honor System at the University of Virginia. The instructor will indicate which assignments and activities are to be done individually and which permit collaboration. The following pledge should be written out at the end of all quizzes, examinations, individual assignments, and papers:  “I pledge that I have neither given nor received help on this examination (quiz, assignment, etc.)”.  The pledge must be signed by the student. For more information, visit www.virginia.edu/honor.


Special Needs:  The University of Virginia accommodates students with disabilities. Any SCPS student with a disability who needs accommodation (e.g., in arrangements for seating, extended time for examinations, or note-taking, etc.), should contact the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) and provide them with appropriate medical or psychological documentation of his/her condition. Once accommodations are approved, just follow up with me concerning any logistics and implementation of accommodations.  Please try to make accommodations for test-taking at least 14 business days in advance of the date of the test(s). Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the SDAC: 434-243-5180/Voice, 434-465-6579/Video Phone, 434-243-5188/Fax. Further policies and statements are available at www.virginia.edu/studenthealth/sdac/sdac.html
