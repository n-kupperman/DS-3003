## About the Course

This course provides practical experiences about how data is commonly used in communication. The general objective is to make you familiar with how to effectively summarize and visualize data in order to share your story. All the examples and analyses will be done mainly in R, with a particular focus on graphical presentations with the R visualization tools like ggplot2, Plotly, and Shiny.

## What You Will Learn Along the Way

    By the end of the course, I hope that you will
    be excited about summarizing and visualizing data using R.
    be able to construct meaningful messages from data and effectively deliver them with visualization tools.
    create a portfolio showcasing your communication and visualization skills.
    have confidence in interacting and collaborating with colleagues.
