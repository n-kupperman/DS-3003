# DS 2003: R and RStudio Installation

## Introduction

Welcome to DS 2003: Communicating with Data

Note that, for now, I assume students have a laptop or desktop computer on which they can install programs. We will be installing R and RStudio. This should all work on a Mac or Windows machine.

Letâ€™s get started!

> - Note: if you are having trouble installing or updating R/RStudio, we will have a check-in the 1st class. Don't fret!

## 1.	Getting your environment ready

R is an open source statistical analysis/computing environment. R's rapid growth in use places it among the most popular statistical analysis software. Much of R's popularity stems from it being open source (and free!) together with its extensible nature. As a programming language, R has become prominent in recent years as a tool for performing high level analytics. As a programming language, R has begun borrowing many tools from the programming world. One of the most prominent among them is R Studio, a free, open source and user-friendly integrated development environment (IDE). An integrated development environment is a tool designed specifically for developing code and analyses using a computer language. In the case of RStudio, the environment is specifically designed for developing "data products" using R.
For this course, we'll be using RStudio for creating open and re-usable code for statistical analysis. You'll need to:
* Install [R for Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) or [R for Mac](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)	
* Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

> - If you already have have R installed on your computer, please confirm the version and update to most recent package if needed.
> - As of 7/12/2022, the most recent version of R is 4.2.1
